## Platform

### Promote Student Leadership and Involvement in Institutional Processes

#### Fund mentor groups, regardless of department or student-led status, because mentor groups should not have to choose between institutional support and autonomy. 
+ Utilize interest from ASPC’s endowment to finance programming, and allocate funds proportional to mentor groups’ number of mentees.
+ Work with DISCOVR and Adaly Martinez, the Director of Accessibility Resources, in the group’s goal to become an official program under the Student Disability Resource Center 

#### Involve and embed students in institutional processes and compensate them for their work.
+ Increase student involvement in hiring and review processes for staff and faculty, and involve students that are not in ASPC in hiring committees
+ Compensate students who participate in the hiring or review process
Increase weekly hours limit for student workers to pre-pandemic allotment of 20 hr/week
