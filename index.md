Hi everyone,
intro
I envision ASPC as …
These are my five main goals: 
bit.ly/vera4pres 
Please reach out to me with any questions or concerns over text, Facebook, or email! I hope to have your support. 

## Platform Outline
- Promote Student Leadership and Involvement in Institutional Processes
- Advance Physical, Social, and Emotional Wellness Through Individual- and Community-Focused Initiatives
- Equity and Inclusion in Academics
- Center Students Through ASPC Initiatives
- Accelerate Pomona’s and ASPC’s Carbon Neutrality Efforts

# Platform

## Promote Student Leadership and Involvement in Institutional Processes

### Fund mentor groups, regardless of department or student-led status, because mentor groups should not have to choose between institutional support and autonomy. 
+ Utilize interest from ASPC’s endowment to finance programming, and allocate funds proportional to mentor groups’ number of mentees.
+ Work with DISCOVR and Adaly Martinez, the Director of Accessibility Resources, in the group’s goal to become an official program under the Student Disability Resource Center 

### Involve and embed students in institutional processes and compensate them for their work.
+ Increase student involvement in hiring and review processes for staff and faculty, and involve students that are not in ASPC in hiring committees
+ Compensate students who participate in the hiring or review process
Increase weekly hours limit for student workers to pre-pandemic allotment of 20 hr/week

## Advance physical, social, and emotional wellness through individual- and community-focused initiatives

### Physical and mental health
- Collaborate with TCCS and Comm. of Wellness to reopen the Health Education Outreach (HEO) office which, until remote learning began, provided a relaxation room, wellness garden, safe sex supples, pregnancy testing and counseling, alcohol and marijuana education, and more
- Work with admin to provide more Pomona-specific mental and physical health resources
  - Many of us have experienced the multi-week wait times at MCAPS and SHS. Hiring more therapists, psychiatrists, physicians, and nurse practitioners is a long-term goal and a 5C-wide initiative. In the meantime, I will work with the Dean of Students to look into hiring staff with drop-in hours for students
- Hire Pomona-specific contact tracers, if COVID testing continues to be a requirement

### Residential life and dining
+ Compel HRL to bring back live-in sponsors and to compensate them—having been a sponsor, I understand the time and care required to build community with first-years. 
+ Incentivize writing room reviews on the ASPC website with Coop gift cards annually
+ Work with the ASPC Software Development Group to enable students to post pictures of residence hall rooms in their reviews
+ Accommodate for students with diverse dietary needs
+ Bring back snack culture!

### Rains Center for Athletics, Recreation, and Wellness
+ Ensure the Center is ready for use prior to pre-season
+ Work with Comm. of Athletics to implement a feedback system for the first two months after opening
+ Work with Comm. of Wellness to build wellness spaces and programming, and establish an ASPC-led womxn workout hours
+ Ensure there are enough student jobs associated with Rains functions, and work with the CDO to ensure jobs are properly advertised on Handshake

### COVID
+ Work with the COVID-19 Planning and Response Group to dissolve the COVID Policy Committee responsible for evaluating COVID policy violations. Send these cases instead to JBoard, which has standardized procedures, students trained to evaluate cases, and an established appeals process
+ Work with the Comm. of Campus Events to plan and hold safe 5C events

## Equity and Inclusion in Academics

## Center Students Through ASPC Initiatives

## Accelerate Pomona’s and ASPC’s Carbon Neutrality Efforts
